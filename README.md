The program objective is to create a free-moving character that has the basic mechanics of a platformer like a jump and walk and all of the objects are simulated with physics calculation(gravity, collision, centrifugal force). There is also a shooting mechanic where the projectiles create a dramatic collision with the objects they collided with. We've also added a collectible system feature that the collectibles when collected make the projectile of the weapon gets larger or smaller, thus making the collision effect(centrifugal force) proportional to the resulted projectile's size.
